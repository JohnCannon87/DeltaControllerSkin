# DeltaControllerSkin

Basic Skin for use with a controller like the Backbone One

Skin will likely only work with iPhone 15 Pro Max (or at least that's all I've tested it with)

To get a skin to show up when a controller is connected set Player 2/3/4 to Touchscreen in the Delta controller settings
